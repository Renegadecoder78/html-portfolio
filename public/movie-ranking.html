<h2>My top 5 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fast & Furious</h3>

<p>It has a lot of action pack and a good story line.</p>

<h3>The Terminator</h3>

<p>This one was an interesting sci-fi.</p>

<h3>Big</h3>

<p>I remember seeing this when it came out. The funny thing is you see Tom Hanks being a big kid.</p>

<h3>Big Trouble in Little China</h3>

<p>This had a of action and comedy in it. Made it very entertaining.</p>

<h3>Ghostbusters</h3>

<p>This one had me on the edge on my seat waiting for one of them to do something to crack me up.</p>
